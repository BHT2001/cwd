  <h1>A conversation</h1>

<p class="Dan">We need to talk, Jack.</p>

<p class="Jack">Alright, Dan, what's this all about? I can spare the time to discuss whatever you need.</p>

<p class="Dan">Did you eat my Butterfinger? I set it in the freezer to preserve its shape In this hot weather, and now its gone.</p>

<p class="Jack">Well... perhaps it melted. Did you ever consider that, instead of pointing finger?</p>

<P class="Dan">You're suggesting a chocolate cylindrical object with a soft yet firm shape, melted in a encasement of freezing temperatures.</P>

<P class="Jack">You say it as though it could never happen. Maybe the power went out and the freezer failed.</P>

<P class="Dan">This was an hour ag- Jack, I swear to god if you laid a finger on my Butterfinger.</P>

<p class="Jack">What if I laid a finger on your damned Butterfinger! It's not like I slapped your child!</p>

<p class="Dan">No, you simply removed them from their ice cold protective casing, and devoured them.</p>

<p class="Jack">We have 'SO' many other Butterfinger's! Why focus on this one?</p>

<p class="Dan">Because, bitch!</p>

<p>*Then they fought.*</p>
