About this page: What motivated me to create this for my assignment, was the fact that I am a huge follower of large gaming industries, yet day after day let downs and drawbacks, along with over-pricing have been becoming a major issue that is cosnatntly getting worse, yet the industries play off as though they're doing the best they have been doing in over a decade.

AI was used to teach and learn concepts and to aid me in understanding terms and some script I was severely struggling with. Nothing was copy/pasted, only used for assistance. I notice the requirements state I need to work on, create, and iterate multiple practice pages. Sadly that is very difficult for me, as when I sit down to work on something, everything else is placed in the background, and I dont halt until I reach the outcome in which I am expecting, regardless of how long this takes. This code was copy/pasted from my submitted unit-1-hello assignemnt, since in my eyes I knew it worked, and prevented me from having to restart from scratch all of the coding and text. I simply edited the existing code until I had a rough draft, and immediately began polishing it until the desired outcome was achieved.-->

<!--Some prompts and concepts were taken from general research from looking up information from the web, which is where I discovered flexbox and other ways of coding. Sadly I don't rely on the courses, which yes does end up making things harder for me, but I lack the patience for those, as in order to stay in tuned with the work, I require constant focus on the on hand task with no distractions besides research and breaks for my wrists from typing. This assignment took a total of 6 hours of nonstop working.-->

    <div class="text-full">
        <div class="left-group"> <p id="f76">Todd Howard has been a grand inspiration for game releases and world building.
With great releases like ‘Fallout 76’- A misfired launch with more than 1,000 unfixed bugs discovered on the games first release,
on outsourced modders and fans to mod and fix the game, while talk of abandoning it, Bethesda's most expensive project, was discussed.</p>

        <p id="starfield"> ‘Starfield’- A walking simulator disguised as SKYRIM IN SPACE, with shallow game-play and even<br>
            shallower RPG mechanics that. But don’t worry, there are over 1,000 planets to explore! and thank ‘Todd’ that only<br>
            8 of them have any real semblance of life on them. Thankfully, you don’t have a vehicle to explore them, so better<br>
        get used to holding ‘W’ and staring at an empty screen for hours on end!</p> </div>

         <div class="right-group"><p id="redfall">‘Redfall’- A vampire hunting simulator with no RPG mechanics, no weapon or<br>
            character variety, no real moral consequences, no combat difficulty, poor AI in enemies mechanics,<br>
        and only a mask of real freedom in game-play. The buggy lord and savior ‘Re-Todd’ has done it yet again.</p>

        <p id="layoff">In 2025 alone, Bethesda laid off over 9,000 people due to their lack of capability to make a functioning product,<br>
            struggled with lawsuits from past games like ‘Fallout 76’, for false advertisement, price gouging, false sales and discounts in an<br>
            attempt to inflate sales overall, and another add-on to the lawsuit of false advertisement for either refusing to ship out products,<br>
        accidentally doxxing the players who purchased the merchandise, or attempted to, and more.</p> </div>

<!-- Working on this assignemnt was anything but simple for me, JavaScript I could not get to do what I wanted for some reason, and for the sake of time for this task I chose to use CSS for the vanishing and rollover effects. I do still plan on working on JavaScript until I figure this out. I did however learn and realize plenty new things. I was unaware that I could use <div></div> to group items and scripts in specifics as many times as needed. I had made the mistake of labeling texts as p1, p2, p3, and so on so forth not realizing I was stripping away the capability to edit them as a group, assuming that <p> was simply universal. I learned how to manipulate pairings, opacity, transition, flexbox's, and that grouping items together with <div></div> meant I could no longer position them individually if they are grouped in CSS script. opacity adjusts the visibility of script on the webpage, transition adjusts its time of visibility when a mouse rolls over an item, flexbox can edit and adjust an entire grouping of text or items, but attempting to edit them individually will cause them to collide and have the code not work outright.-->
